### 1. Project Description
This master project aims to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting changes in the S&P 500 stock price based on sentiment analysis of FOMC textual data and advanced time series modeling. It's tailored for DSCI 631, offering a hands-on experience in cutting-edge data analysis techniques.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis and Feature Aggregation & Selection
This section delves into the methodologies of sentiment analysis, focusing on the sentiment analysis of financial texts. It includes specific techniques like Loughran and McDonald and FiGAS (Fine-Grained Aspect-based Sentiment analysis).

### 3. Time Series Modeling: ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM
Time series modeling is explored through ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. This section provides an in-depth understanding of these models and their application in predicting financial time series data.

### 4. Data Acquisition and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This part covers data acquisition techniques and initial exploratory data analysis methods. It's structured to facilitate understanding of data gathering and analysis for financial datasets.
